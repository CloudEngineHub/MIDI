MIDI is a **novel paradigm** for compositional 3D scene generation from a single image. MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to **multi-instance diffusion models**, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability.
